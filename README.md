# Timed-Quiz Web API Challenge

## Description

With this challenge I implemented my HTML, CSS framework (bootstrap) and javascript knowledge. I created a coding quiz page that uses a time feature to keep a score to later integrate as a local storage high score option. I integrated javascript to successfully show a set of questions and differentiate the correct from the wrong answer per submission.

## Installation
1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view webpage
3. Use a text editor to view all coding, Visual Studio Coding is recommended.

## User Story 

- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
